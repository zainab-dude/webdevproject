# App Icons Required

To make your PWA installable, you need to create two icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Solution

You can use online tools to generate these icons:

- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/

Or create them manually:
- Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
- Create square images with the CapShala logo
- Export as PNG files
- Name them exactly: `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`
- Place them in the `public` folder

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can use any square image and rename it. The app will work, but you'll see a default icon when installing.

## Icon Design Tips

- Use the CapShala brand color (#6A0DAD) as background
- Include the text "CapShala" or a logo
- Make sure text/logo is centered and visible
- Use high contrast for visibility
